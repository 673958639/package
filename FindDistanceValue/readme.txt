Obviously, the question is to determine whether the absolute value of the difference between arr1 and arr2 conforms to the definition of distance.If <=d occurs, we can ignore this judgment and directly judge the next comparison.Therefore, we can use a double loop, in case of an undefined jump, and execute the next loop and increment the value of count by one.When the value of count is the same as the length of the second array, add 1 to res.And every time you execute a number in arr1, clear count to 0.
The time complexity of this string of code is O(n^2), and space complexity is O(n). Memory consumption is 3.8mb.
