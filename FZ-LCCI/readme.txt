When we do this problem, we should think about the way zero is generated.Because they want to figure out how many trailing zeros there are, this number must be a multiple of 10.And since 10 can be divided into 2¡¯s and 5¡¯s, as long as there are 5¡¯s, then 2¡¯s must be there before 5¡¯s, so we can just think about whether it¡¯s a multiple of 5.So you divide that by 5 and you get the number of times that you¡¯re trailing 0.And then divide n by 5 for the next loop.So if you add up their answers, that¡¯s the number of trailing zeros. The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1). The memory consumption is 2 Mb.
