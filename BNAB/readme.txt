I couldn't bring the best solution to the reader after spending nearly an hour. However, I found a very simple and clever way of thinking in other people's problem solving. The following code extracts the last bit each time and continues the program if it is different from the previous bit. If it is the same as the previous bit, then print false directly. It is worth noting that the author first declared that t=2, which is a point that I did not think of, in the use of this point, the original author's thinking is very clever. Through the complexity analysis, I can get the time and space complexity of this code. Its time complexity is O(n), and its space complexity is O(n). It consumes only 1.9 MB of memory. From a time and space-complexity perspective, this code is efficient and has a low memory footprint.
