This is an interesting problem.We can start with the problem.So what they want us to do is they want us to reverse the input string, so we can split the input string in half.The first character is interchanged with the last character.Because we don¡¯t need any extra space, we just need 1 to swap with n, 2 to swap with n minus 1, and so on. The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1). Memory consumption is 6.3 Mb.
