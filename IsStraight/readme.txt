It¡¯s not hard to think of the formula for y equals kx plus b when you do this problem.We can get the value of k by two simultaneous equations. Similarly, we define k as a floating point number in our code, and if the k values of two adjacent points are equal, then we can conclude that these points are on the same line in the coordinate system. If there are two adjacent points whose k value is not equal to that of the others, then some of these points must not be on the same line. Here, I also consider what happens when there is only one point, but the requirement says 2 <= coordinates. length <= 1000, so you can ignore lines 15 and 16 in the code.
