The brute force method is divided into three cases, two Numbers are the same, three Numbers are the same and three Numbers are not the same, and then narrow the loop upper and lower bounds. If you have the same number, the maximum you can do is not greater than target over 2. If all three Numbers are different, the smallest number is not greater than target over 3 and the second number is not greater than target over 2.
Since it¡¯s not divisible, everything is given a plus 1 in case there¡¯s a number that doesn¡¯t loop. The time complexity is O(n^3), and the space complexity is O(1). The memory consumption is 3.2Mb.
