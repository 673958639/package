First of all, when there¡¯s only one digit in the array, if it¡¯s 0, then the missing number is 1, or if it¡¯s 1, then the missing number is 0. We arrange the array in order once, and walk through the relationship between each number and the next. If appear nums [i] + 1!=num[i+1], then we just need to return the value of num[I]+1. Of course this is under the condition that the missing number is not zero. If the missing number is 0, 0 is returned. If zero to the last digit is not missing, return the last digit plus 1.
