And when we do this, we should think about how to convert the Numbers in array A to the appropriate X.That is, by adding the values of X and K to a normal number, the final answer is converted into an array.So we just have to put in one bit at a time until we run out of digits to see if we can get a full X.Its time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n). The memory consumption is 6.3Mb.
