This question mainly focuses on the knowledge of substitution in go language. The problem is to replace all the space strings with 20%. And there is enough space at the end of the string for the new characters to know the length of the string. So we can set the length read in S to be the maximum length set. Here¡¯s a little bit about the replace method.Strings.Replace(s, old, new, -1), s is the string, old is the string to be replaced, new is the string to be replaced.-1 represents the replacement of all old strings, and if n>0 returns a new string that replaces the first n nonoverlapping old substrings in s with new. This code is O (n) in time complexity and O (n) in space complexity.
