When we do this, the first thing we need to think about is whether we can find the second string from the first string.If it cannot be found, it returns negative 1.Returns 0 if the second string is empty.We want to find the position of the first digit in the second string in the first string and compare it with the subsequent characters of the second string length -1.If equal, returns the length of the second string. The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1).
