They want the absolute value of the difference between the two Numbers to be k, so k has to be greater than or equal to 0, and when k is less than 0, the program returns 0.In this case, we can use the hash table to avoid the effect of the same elements in the array.The problem requires that the difference between the two elements be 2, so we only need to determine whether num + - 2 is also in the hash table.Use a new hash table to record the larger values, and return the length of the hash table is the answer.
