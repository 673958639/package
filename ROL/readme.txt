In solving this problem, we should choose two Pointers.The first pointer starts at the beginning and the second pointer starts at the end.You just have to decide if it¡¯s a letter and reverse it.We can use ASCII code to determine whether a string is a letter or a character. The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n). The memory consumption is 2Mb.
