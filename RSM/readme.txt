Subtract the sum array.Calculate the sum of the previous I Numbers in advance, that is, a[I] is equal to the sum of the interval [1, I], and the consumption time is O(n).The sum of the interval [I,j] is: sum(I,j) = a[j] -a [I -1], the elapsed time of each query is O(1), and the time complexity of k queries is O(k).So in general, it¡¯s O(n+k). The space complexity is O(n). The time consumption is 8.4Mb.
