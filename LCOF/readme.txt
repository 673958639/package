When we solve this problem, we should think about how many jokers there are.I¡¯m going to sort the cards, sort them in ascending order.Find out how many jokers there are.Because they don¡¯t give you the key information about how many cards there are or how many jokers there are. So we analyze different Numbers of trumps to see if the deck is a good one. The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1). The memory consumption is 2.1Mb.
